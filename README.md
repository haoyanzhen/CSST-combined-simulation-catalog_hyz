# csst_simulation_catalog-hyz

*This is the first time that I pull codes to github. If there is any question, please confirmly let me know. As a beginner of coding, I will be appreciated if any advice could help.*

*Simulation catalog generation created by hyz, containing different ways to generate catalogs for CSST simulation observation.*

*The codes were not carefully revised, remaining a complete clumsy development process.*

> There are three catalogs used in these codes: [Gaia](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/), [CSST-Trilegal], simulation catalog provided by xxx.
## cat_extraction-galaxycenter
A combination of Gaia and CSST-Trilegal catalog.
